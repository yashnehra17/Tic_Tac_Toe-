# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic-tac-toe also known as noughts and crosses is a paper and pencil game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 x 3 grid traditionally. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. It is a zero-sum of perfect information game. This means that it is deterministic, with fully observable environments in which two agents act alternately and the utility values at the end of the game are always equal and opposite. Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as pedagogical tool in artificial intelligence to deal with searching of game trees. The optimal move for this game can be gained by using minimax algorithm, where the opposition between the utility functions makes the situation adversarial, hence requiring adversarial search supported by minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning concept in artificial intelligence.
